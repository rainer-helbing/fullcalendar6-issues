This project shows a `resourceTimelineWeek` view, where the html of the resource column was produced with `resourceLabelContent`.

The project uses fullcalendar 5.11.4. Its display is correct. 

## resourceLabelContent_fc_6

This project shows a `resourceTimelineWeek` view, where the html of the resource column was produced with `resourceLabelContent`.

The project uses fullcalendar 6.1.1. Its display is **not** correct. 

## dateClick_event_fc_6

This Project explores how to add a doubleckick event to fullcalendar. My solution: use `DateClickArg.jsEvent.detail` - see [UIEvent.detail](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UIEvent/detail)
